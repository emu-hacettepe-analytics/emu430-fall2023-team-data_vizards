Our main focus is In Migration of internal cities. In this regard, migration trends between different regions such as Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia, Aegean, Marmara will be determined and migration relations between big cities and other cities will be analyzed in detail. The relationship between population density and migration will be determined by examining migration rates, especially in cities with large populations. Migration trends will be evaluated according to age groups, gender, educational status and reasons for migration. (retirement, appointment, etc.) Also, the economic development level of the economic region will be interpreted according to the labor force, household disposable income, number of enterprises, number of housing sales, etc. This comprehensive analysis will guide our project in understanding Turkey’s migration situation.\n\n\nData Set\nMigration Data\nPopulation\nData of 26 Region\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Box plot shows that education is the most common reason for migration followed by migration due to a family member and better life conditions.\nWhen plotting the box plot we scaled y values to log2 scale to see the distribution better and we ordered the box plots to make it easier to understand which are the most and the least causes of migration.\n\nregion_plot &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; select(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value,regions) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value)) + geom_point(aes(color = regions)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Regions and Reasons for Migration\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n  ylab(\"Migration Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")  \nprint(region_plot)\n\n\n\n\nWhen we analyze migration reasons on a regional basis, we observe that under the category of ‘different reasons,’ the highest migration has occurred to the Marmara region. Following the Marmara region, the second-highest migration took place to the Central Anatolia region. This drew our attention to a few points. We had expected that the highest migration due to retirement would be to the Mediterranean or Aegean regions, but it turned out that the majority of migration happened to the Marmara region.\n\ncity_plot &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; filter(city %in% c(\"Ankara\",\"D0stanbul\",\"D0zmir\",\"Antalya\",\"Trabzon\",\"AD\u001frD1\",\"E\u001eanlD1urfa\")) |&gt; select(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value,city) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value)) + geom_point(aes(color = city)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Metropolitan Cities and Reasons for Migration\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n  ylab(\"Migration Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")  \nprint(city_plot)\n\n\n\n\nWhile creating this graph, we included the most populous cities of each region because plotting for all 81 provinces would be quite challenging. As seen in this graph, the highest migration, due to different reasons, has been to Istanbul, followed by Ankara. What surprised us again is that the highest migration due to retirement is to D0stanbul and Ankara.”\n\nlast_migration_tidy_data |&gt; mutate(agerange2 = reorder(agerange2, agerange_value2, FUN = median)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(agerange2,agerange_value2,fill = agerange2)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + ggtitle(\"Immigration Data of Age Ranges\") + xlab(\"Age Ranges\") +\n  ylab(\"Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\") \n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the Immigration Data of Age Ranges, we see that the most immigration age range is 20-24. We can say that education was the highest value among the reasons for immigration and this is consistent with this. Likewise, the second place is 15-19. It can be interpreted that high school students also migrate for education. “finjob” ranks in the middle list of reasons for migration. If we consider 25-29 as the age for finding a job, we can comment that people aged 25-29 do not migrate only for the purpose of finding a job. For example, they may have migrated due to better living conditions. When we look at the graph, we see that the migration age of 40-44 migrates the least compared to other ages. In my opinion, I can conclude from the graph that people who are used to a certain order no longer want change. According to the chart, 10-14 years old is the second to last migration age range. “familymig” ranked second among the reasons for migration. I can say that there is a contradiction here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata &lt;- last_tidy_data_education2 %&gt;%\n  select(regions, education, education_value, fertilityrate) \neducation_fertility &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(regions) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_education = mean(education_value),\n            avg_fertility = mean(fertilityrate))\nggplot(education_fertility, aes(x = avg_education, y = avg_fertility, label = regions)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(hjust = 0, vjust = 0, size = 3, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Education Level and Fertility Rate in Geographical Regions\",\n       x = \"Average Education Level\",\n       y = \"Average Fertility Rate\") + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 50000))\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, as the education level increases, the fertility rate decreases. you can see. You can also see that there are differences between geographical regions. For example, the Eastern Anatolia Region has the lowest education level and the highest fertility rate. This may indicate that the region is inadequate in terms of education and job opportunities. While it attracts attention as a region, the Marmara Region has the highest education level and the lowest fertility rate.It may prove to be attractive in terms of education and job opportunities. It appears as a region.There appears to be a negative relationship between average education level and average fertility rate. That is, as the education level increases, the fertility rate decreases. This may indicate that educated women tend to have fewer children.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmerged_data &lt;- population %&gt;%\n  inner_join(migration, by = \"city\") %&gt;%\n  select(city, region2id, university2, highschool2, middleschool2, elementaryschool2)\n\nmerged_data_tidy &lt;- merged_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(university2, highschool2, middleschool2, elementaryschool2),\n               names_to = \"education_level\", values_to = \"migration_count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(region2id, education_level) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_migration = sum(migration_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'region2id'.

These regions cover the northwestern, western and southwestern regions of Turkey. It may indicate that these regions are more attractive in terms of education and job opportunities. It is seen that immigrants with low education level mostly migrate to TR81, TR82 and TRA2 regions. These regions cover the northeastern, eastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. It may indicate that these regions are poorer in terms of education and job opportunities. It may indicate that other Regions are average in terms of education and job opportunities.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmerged_data &lt;- inner_join(population, migration, by = \"city\") %&gt;%\n  select(city, region2id, university2, doctorate, highschool2, elementaryschool2, finjob)\neducation_migration &lt;- merged_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(university2, doctorate, highschool2, elementaryschool2),\n               names_to = \"education_level\", values_to = \"migration_count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    education_level = case_when(\n      education_level == \"university2\" ~ \"University\",\n      education_level == \"doctorate\" ~ \"Doctorate\",\n      education_level == \"highschool2\" ~ \"High School\",\n      education_level == \"elementaryschool2\" ~ \"Elementary School\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(education_level)\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(education_migration, aes(x = education_level, y = migration_count, fill = education_level)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Migration by Education Level\",\n       x = \"Education Level\",\n       y = \"Migration Count\",\n       fill = \"Education Level\") +\n  theme_minimal() + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\nOn the x axis, there are four education levels: doctorate, primary school, high school and university. On the Y axis, the number of people migrating is shown with values ranging from 0 to 100,000. In the graph, the number of migrations of individuals at doctoral or primary school level is much less than that of individuals at high school and university levels. In the graph, the highest number of migrations is seen among individuals at university level. This is followed by individuals at the high school level. It is seen that individuals with a higher level of education migrate less than individuals with a lower level of education. This may indicate that individuals with higher levels of education are more dependent on working conditions or find fewer job opportunities. It is seen that individuals with low education levels migrate more than individuals with high education levels. This may indicate that individuals with lower levels of education strive more to improve their living conditions or are under more pressure.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data source: TÜİK\nWe transferred the data we received from TÜİK as an Excel file onto R with the read_excel( ) function in the readxl library.\nIn this code, we created “region2id” column for cities in population data set by using region26 data set. Our aim is to have common area (column) for all the data sets (population, region26 and migration) to study on the data sets comfortable. Additionaly, we renamed the columns to make it easier to work in R by using names() function. In this code, we created “region2id” column for cities in population data set by using region26 data set. Our aim is to have common area (column) for all the data sets (population, region26 and migration) to study on the data sets comfortable. Additionaly, We renamed the columns to make it easier to work in R by using names() function and we tidy up our data sets with the help of the pivot_longer() function to work with these datasets more flexibly and facilitate visualization. The tidy data sets names are last_migration_tidy_data, tidy_region26 and last_population_tidy_data respectively. Appart from this operation,using the population data set, we added the city column and region column to both the migration data set in tidy form and the migration data set in wide form to do better visualization.\nIn population data frame, we used 31 columns. IDD is the code that identifies the district or region. It will be used in migration analysis to track migration patterns between different regions. Region ID and regions reflect the region ID and name. Migration data will be examined on a regional basis to understand population movements between different regions. Totalpop, male, female, corresponds to total population, male population and female population. It will be used in migration analysis to understand how populations change from one region to another.\nAge groups (age04, age59, age1014, age1519, age2024, age2529, age3034, age3539, age4044, other age) symbolize the population distribution of different age groups. Migration data will be used to examine migration trends of certain age groups from one region to another. Unknowns indicate unknown or uncertain population information. When analyzing migration, the impact of missing data and how this data may affect migration trends will be important.\nEducation levels (doctorate, primary edu, primary edu, elementary edu, highschool, literatebutnoschool, notliterate, middleschool, master university) give the population distribution at different education levels. It will be used to analyze the cities receiving immigrants according to their education levels. Fertility rate, the effect of the fertility rate, which is one of the factors affecting the tendency of individuals to migrate from one region to another, will be examined.\nElectricity reflects Total Electricity Consumption (Kwh) per capita data. Migration may be towards areas with better infrastructure or living conditions. Migration may occur due to housing sales numbers, changes in the housing market, and trends in housing sales will be important in migration analysis.\nIn migration data frame, we used 28 columns. Since it contains common columns with the population dataframe, we explain below the columns that are different from the population data frame.\nTurnbackfamily will provide information about the return loss of families, the rate of families migrating, or the return rates of families migrating. Betterlifecond, the search for better living conditions may be one of the reasons why people migrate. Others reflect other reasons for migration. This category includes a variety of reasons that are not specifically defined but may be associated with migration. Retirement refers to relocation after retirement or migration to preferred provinces for retirement.\nBuyhome reflects home buying data. An increase in housing sales in a particular region will indicate that migration to that region has increased and people prefer that region. Familymig describes migrations that occur for family reasons. It represents migrations due to family reunification or family relationships.\nFinjob indicates migrations for job opportunities or finding a job. People may be more likely to migrate for work or career opportunities. It describes situations such as change of marital status, marriage, and divorce. Health refers to migrations that occur for health reasons. Appointment represents a new business opportunity or change.\nThere are 5 columns in our region 26 data frame. We explain the columns that are different from our population and migration data frame below. Region2id is the second region code specified. Workforce15plus and workforce1564 reflect workforce data aged 15 and over and workforce data between ages 15-64, respectively. This data can influence workforce dynamics in a particular region. The labor force participation rate or workforce structure of migrating individuals may be important in terms of economic impacts and changes in employment. Usableincome symbolizes disposable income or income level. This data can affect income levels and economic well-being. Migration in a particular region can cause changes in income distribution and living standards in that region.\n\n# importing necessary packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(readr)\n\npopulation &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\")\nnames(population) &lt;- c('IDD','city','regionid','regions','totalpop','male','female','age04','age59','age1014','age1519','age2024','age2529','age3034','age3539','age4044','otherage','unknowns','doctorate','primaryedu','elementaryedu','highschool','literatebutnoschool','notliterate','middleschool','master','university','fertilityrate','electricity','numberofattempts','housingsalesnumbers')\n\nregion26 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\", sheet = \"Bolge26\")\nnames(region26) &lt;- c('region','region2id','workforce15plus','workforce1564','usableincome')\n\nmigration &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\", sheet = \"Goc Bilgileri\")\nnames(migration) &lt;- c('IDD','male2','female2','turnbackfamily','unknowns2','betterlifecond','others','education','retirement','buyhome','familymig','finjob','maritalstatuschange','health','appointment','age04_2','age59_2','age1014_2','age1519_2','age2024_2','age2529_2','age3034_2','age3539_2','age4044_2','university2','highschool2','middleschool2', 'elementaryschool2')\n\n\n# tidy migration data set\nmigration$city &lt;- population$city\nmigration$regions &lt;- population$regions\n\ntidy_data_gender &lt;- migration |&gt; pivot_longer(c(male2,female2),names_to = \"gender2\",values_to = \"gender_value2\")\n\ntidy_data_causes &lt;- tidy_data_gender |&gt; pivot_longer(c(turnbackfamily,unknowns2,betterlifecond,others,education,\n                                                retirement,buyhome,familymig,finjob,maritalstatuschange,health,appointment),names_to = \"migrationcauses\",values_to = \"migrationcauses_value\")\n\ntidy_data_age &lt;- tidy_data_causes |&gt; pivot_longer(c(age04_2,age59_2,age1014_2,age1519_2,\n                                                    age2024_2,age2529_2,age3034_2,age3539_2,age4044_2),names_to = \"agerange2\",values_to = \"agerange_value2\")\n\nlast_migration_tidy_data &lt;- tidy_data_age |&gt; pivot_longer(c(university2,highschool2,middleschool2,elementaryschool2),names_to = \"education2\",values_to = \"education_value2\")\n\n\n# tidy region26 data set\ntidy_region26 &lt;- region26 |&gt; pivot_longer(c(workforce15plus,workforce1564),names_to = \"workforce\",values_to = \"workforce_values\")\n\n\n# tidy population data set\ntidy_data_gender2 &lt;- population |&gt; pivot_longer(c(male,female),names_to = \"gender\",values_to = \"gender_value\") \n\ntidy_data_age &lt;- tidy_data_gender2 |&gt; pivot_longer(c(age04,age59,age1014,age1519,\n                                                    age2024,age2529,age3034,age3539,age4044,otherage),names_to = \"agerange\",values_to = \"agerange_value\")\n\ntidy_literate &lt;- tidy_data_age |&gt; pivot_longer(c(unknowns,literatebutnoschool,notliterate),names_to = \"literate\",values_to = \"literate_values\")\n\nlast_tidy_data_education2 &lt;- tidy_literate|&gt; pivot_longer(c(university,highschool,middleschool,elementaryedu,doctorate,primaryedu,master),names_to = \"education\",values_to = \"education_value\")\n\nlast_population_tidy_data &lt;- last_tidy_data_education2 |&gt; pivot_longer(c(fertilityrate,electricity,numberofattempts,housingsalesnumbers),names_to = \"othervariables\",values_to = \"othervariables_value\")\n\n\npopulation$`region2id`&lt;- \"\"\nfor (i in 1:nrow(population)) {\n  city &lt;- population$city[i]\n  \n  for (j in 1:length(region26$region)) {\n    if (grepl(city, region26$region[j])) {\n      population$`region2id`[i] &lt;- paste(region26$`region2id`[j])\n      break \n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
