Our main focus is In Migration of internal cities. In this regard, migration trends between different regions such as Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia, Aegean, Marmara will be determined and migration relations between big cities and other cities will be analyzed in detail. The relationship between population density and migration will be determined by examining migration rates, especially in cities with large populations. Migration trends will be evaluated according to age groups, gender, educational status and reasons for migration. (retirement, appointment, etc.) Also, the economic development level of the economic region will be interpreted according to the labor force, household disposable income, number of enterprises, number of housing sales, etc. This comprehensive analysis will guide our project in understanding Turkey’s migration situation.\n\n\nData Set\nMigration Data\nPopulation\nData of 26 Region\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Box plot shows that education is the most common reason for migration followed by migration due to a family member and better life conditions.\nWhen plotting the box plot we scaled y values to log2 scale to see the distribution better and we ordered the box plots to make it easier to understand which are the most and the least causes of migration.\n\nregion_plot &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; select(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value,regions) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value)) + geom_point(aes(color = regions)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Regions and Reasons for Migration\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n  ylab(\"Migration Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")  \nprint(region_plot)\n\n\n\n\nWhen we analyze migration reasons on a regional basis, we observe that under the category of ‘different reasons,’ the highest migration has occurred to the Marmara region. Following the Marmara region, the second-highest migration took place to the Central Anatolia region. This drew our attention to a few points. We had expected that the highest migration due to retirement would be to the Central Anatolian Region or Aegean Region, but it turned out that the majority of migration happened to the Marmara region.\n\ncity_plot &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; filter(city %in% c(\"Ankara\",\"İstanbul\",\"İzmir\",\"Antalya\",\"Trabzon\",\"Ağrı\",\"Şanlıurfa\")) |&gt; select(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value,city) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,migrationcauses_value)) + geom_point(aes(color = city)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Metropolitan Cities and Reasons for Migration\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n  ylab(\"Migration Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")  \nprint(city_plot)\n\n\n\n\nWhile creating this graph, we included the most populous cities of each region because plotting for all 81 provinces would be quite challenging. As seen in this graph, the highest migration, due to different reasons, has been to Istanbul, followed by Ankara. What surprised us again is that the highest migration due to retirement is to İstanbul and Ankara.”\n\nmigration_gender2 &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; mutate(rate = (last_migration_tidy_data$migrationcauses_value) / (last_migration_tidy_data$gender_value2))\n\nregion_rate_plot &lt;- migration_gender2 |&gt; ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,rate)) + geom_point(aes(color = regions)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Regions and Migration Rates\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n  ylab(\"Migration Rates\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")\n  print(region_rate_plot)\n\n\n\n\nIn the above plots , plotted values were migration values with respect to migration reason and we got some results that we were not expecting. To understand the situation deeply we plotted migration rates rather than migration values and result was more of what we were expected to see. For example migration due to retirement was actually occurring to Central Anatolian Region and Black Sea Region.\n\nmigration_gender2 &lt;- last_migration_tidy_data |&gt; mutate(rate = (last_migration_tidy_data$migrationcauses_value) / (last_migration_tidy_data$gender_value2))\ncity_rate_plot &lt;- migration_gender2 |&gt; filter(city %in% c(\"Ankara\",\"İstanbul\",\"İzmir\",\"Antalya\",\"Trabzon\",\"Ağrı\",\"Şanlıurfa\")) |&gt; ggplot(aes(migrationcauses,rate)) + geom_point(aes(color = city)) +\n    ggtitle(\"Metropolitan Cities and Migration Rates\") + xlab(\"Migration Causes\") +\n    ylab(\"Migration Rates\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\")  \n  print(city_rate_plot) \n\n\n\n\nIn the same fashion, the city that people migrate the most due to retirement is Trabzon followed by İzmir and Ankara\n\nlast_migration_tidy_data |&gt; mutate(agerange2 = reorder(agerange2, agerange_value2, FUN = median)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(agerange2,agerange_value2,fill = agerange2)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + ggtitle(\"Immigration Data of Age Ranges\") + xlab(\"Age Ranges\") +\n  ylab(\"Values\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab(\"\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\") \n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the graph, we see that the age range of the people who migrate the most is 20-24. The 15-19 age range ranks second. The age range of people who migrate the least is observed to be 40-44. When we look at the Immigration Data of Age Ranges, we see that the most immigration age range is 20-24. We can say that education was the highest value among the reasons for immigration and this is consistent with this. Likewise, the second place is 15-19. It can be interpreted that high school students also migrate for education. “finjob” ranks in the middle list of reasons for migration. If we consider 25-29 as the age for finding a job, we can comment that people aged 25-29 do not migrate only for the purpose of finding a job. For example, they may have migrated due to better living conditions. When we look at the graph, we see that the migration age of 40-44 migrates the least compared to other ages. In our opinion, we can conclude from the graph that people who are used to a certain order no longer want change. According to the chart, 10-14 years old is the second to last migration age range. “familymig” ranked second among the reasons for migration. We can say that there is a contradiction here. We would have expected a higher number of people migrating for health reasons. Health is very important for everyone, but unfortunately health services are not developed everywhere. Health problems are a factor that can be seen in all age groups, so we would expect the values to be high.\n\ncor(last_migration_tidy_data$migrationcauses_value, last_migration_tidy_data$agerange_value2)\n\n[1] 0.4977804\n\n\nThis value indicates a moderate positive relationship between migration reasons and age ranges.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Extracting necessary columns from the 'last_tidy_data_education2' dataset\ndata &lt;- last_tidy_data_education2 %&gt;%\n  select(regions, education, education_value, fertilityrate) \n# Calculating average education and fertility rate per region\neducation_fertility &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(regions) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    avg_education = mean(education_value),  # Calculating the mean education value for each region\n    avg_fertility = mean(fertilityrate)     # Calculating the mean fertility rate for each region\n  )\n# Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between education level and fertility rate across regions\nggplot(education_fertility, aes(x = avg_education, y = avg_fertility, label = regions)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +  # Adding points to represent each region\n  geom_text(hjust = 0, vjust = 0, size = 3, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.8) +  # Adding text labels for regions\n  labs(\n    title = \"Education Level and Fertility Rate in Geographical Regions\",  # Title of the plot\n    x = \"Average Education Level\",  # X-axis label\n    y = \"Average Fertility Rate\"     # Y-axis label\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 50000))  # Formatting X-axis labels\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot does not show a clear correlation between the average education level and fertility rate across regions. The points representing different regions are scattered without showing a clear trend of increase or decrease. The region with the highest average education level is Marmara, with about 250,000 units of education value. The region with the lowest average education level is Eastern Anatolia Region, with about 50,000 units of education value. The region with the highest average fertility rate is Central Anatolia Region, with above 2.0 children per woman. The region with the lowest average fertility rate is the Marmara Region, with below 1.5 children per woman. There are some outliers in the data, such as Central Anatolia Region, which has a relatively high average education level but also a high average fertility rate, and Mediterranean Region, which has a relatively low average education level but also a low average fertility rate. These outliers may indicate that there are other factors influencing the fertility rate besides the education level, such as culture, religion, income, etc. The surprising point in this data is that I expected the Eastern Anatolia Region to have the highest fertility rate. The low population registration rates in that region may be one of the reasons affecting the data output. According to TUIK data, the population registration rate of the Eastern Anatolia Region is 97.92%, which is 98.82% below the Turkey average. This may mean that some of the children born in this region are not registered.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Merging population and migration datasets based on the 'city' column\nmerged_data &lt;- population %&gt;%\n  inner_join(migration, by = \"city\") %&gt;%\n  # Selecting specific columns from the merged dataset\n  select(city, region2id, university2, highschool2, middleschool2, elementaryschool2)\n\n# Transforming the merged data into a tidy format using pivot_longer\nmerged_data_tidy &lt;- merged_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(university2, highschool2, middleschool2, elementaryschool2),\n    names_to = \"education_level\",\n    values_to = \"migration_count\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Grouping by region and education level to calculate total migration counts\n  group_by(region2id, education_level) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_migration = sum(migration_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  # Renaming education levels for better readability\n  mutate(\n    education_level = case_when(\n      education_level == \"university2\" ~ \"University\",\n      education_level == \"middleschool2\" ~ \"Middle School\",\n      education_level == \"highschool2\" ~ \"High School\",\n      education_level == \"elementaryschool2\" ~ \"Elementary School\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(education_level)\n    )\n  )  \n\n# Sorting regions based on total migration counts\nsorted_regions &lt;- merged_data_tidy %&gt;%\n  group_by(region2id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_migration = sum(total_migration, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_migration)) %&gt;% \n  pull(region2id)\n\n# Reordering factor levels of 'region2id' based on sorted regions\nmerged_data_tidy$region2id &lt;- factor(merged_data_tidy$region2id, levels = sorted_regions)\n\n# Creating a stacked bar plot to visualize migration distribution by education levels across regions\nggplot(merged_data_tidy, aes(x = region2id, y = total_migration, fill = education_level)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +  # Stacked bar plot\n  labs(\n    title = \"Migration Distribution by Education Levels for 26 Regions\",  # Title of the plot\n    x = \"Regions\",  # X-axis label\n    y = \"Number of People Immigrating\",  # Y-axis label\n    fill = \"Education Levels\"  # Legend label\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotating x-axis labels for better readability\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +  # Setting color palette for education levels\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  # Formatting Y-axis labels using commas for better readability\n\n\n\n\nIt is seen that immigrants with high education levels mostly migrate to regions numbered TR10, TR51 and TR42. These regions cover the northwestern, western and southwestern regions of Turkey. It may indicate that these regions are more attractive in terms of education and job opportunities. It is seen that immigrants with low education level mostly migrate to TR81, TR82 and TRA2 regions. These regions cover the northeastern, eastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. It may indicate that these regions are poorer in terms of education and job opportunities.

On the Y axis, the number of people migrating is shown with values ranging from 0 to 100,000. In the graph, the number of migrations of individuals at doctoral or primary school level is much less than that of individuals at high school and university levels. In the graph, the highest number of migrations is seen among individuals at university level. This is followed by individuals at the high school level. It is seen that individuals with a higher level of education migrate less than individuals with a lower level of education. This may indicate that individuals with higher levels of education are more dependent on working conditions or find fewer job opportunities. It is seen that individuals with low education levels migrate more than individuals with high education levels. This may indicate that individuals with lower levels of education strive more to improve their living conditions or are under more pressure.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Additionaly, we renamed the columns to make it easier to work in R by using names() function. In this code, we created “region2id” column for cities in population data set by using region26 data set. Our aim is to have common area (column) for all the data sets (population, region26 and migration) to study on the data sets comfortable. Additionaly, We renamed the columns to make it easier to work in R by using names() function and we tidy up our data sets with the help of the pivot_longer() function to work with these datasets more flexibly and facilitate visualization. The tidy data sets names are last_migration_tidy_data, tidy_region26 and last_population_tidy_data respectively. Appart from this operation,using the population data set, we added the city column and region column to both the migration data set in tidy form and the migration data set in wide form to do better visualization.\nIn population data frame, we used 31 columns. IDD is the code that identifies the district or region. It will be used in migration analysis to track migration patterns between different regions. Region ID and regions reflect the region ID and name. Migration data will be examined on a regional basis to understand population movements between different regions. Totalpop, male, female, corresponds to total population, male population and female population. It will be used in migration analysis to understand how populations change from one region to another.\nAge groups (age04, age59, age1014, age1519, age2024, age2529, age3034, age3539, age4044, other age) symbolize the population distribution of different age groups. Migration data will be used to examine migration trends of certain age groups from one region to another. Unknowns indicate unknown or uncertain population information. When analyzing migration, the impact of missing data and how this data may affect migration trends will be important.\nEducation levels (doctorate, primary edu, primary edu, elementary edu, highschool, literatebutnoschool, notliterate, middleschool, master university) give the population distribution at different education levels. It will be used to analyze the cities receiving immigrants according to their education levels. Fertility rate, the effect of the fertility rate, which is one of the factors affecting the tendency of individuals to migrate from one region to another, will be examined.\nElectricity reflects Total Electricity Consumption (Kwh) per capita data. Migration may be towards areas with better infrastructure or living conditions. Migration may occur due to housing sales numbers, changes in the housing market, and trends in housing sales will be important in migration analysis.\nIn migration data frame, we used 28 columns. Since it contains common columns with the population dataframe, we explain below the columns that are different from the population data frame.\nTurnbackfamily will provide information about the return loss of families, the rate of families migrating, or the return rates of families migrating. Betterlifecond, the search for better living conditions may be one of the reasons why people migrate. Others reflect other reasons for migration. This category includes a variety of reasons that are not specifically defined but may be associated with migration. Retirement refers to relocation after retirement or migration to preferred provinces for retirement.\nBuyhome reflects home buying data. An increase in housing sales in a particular region will indicate that migration to that region has increased and people prefer that region. Familymig describes migrations that occur for family reasons. It represents migrations due to family reunification or family relationships.\nFinjob indicates migrations for job opportunities or finding a job. People may be more likely to migrate for work or career opportunities. It describes situations such as change of marital status, marriage, and divorce. Health refers to migrations that occur for health reasons. Appointment represents a new business opportunity or change.\nThere are 5 columns in our region 26 data frame. We explain the columns that are different from our population and migration data frame below. Region2id is the second region code specified. Workforce15plus and workforce1564 reflect workforce data aged 15 and over and workforce data between ages 15-64, respectively. This data can influence workforce dynamics in a particular region. The labor force participation rate or workforce structure of migrating individuals may be important in terms of economic impacts and changes in employment. Usableincome symbolizes disposable income or income level. This data can affect income levels and economic well-being. Migration in a particular region can cause changes in income distribution and living standards in that region.\n\n# importing necessary packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(readr)\n\npopulation &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\")\nnames(population) &lt;- c('IDD','city','regionid','regions','totalpop','male','female','age04','age59','age1014','age1519','age2024','age2529','age3034','age3539','age4044','otherage','unknowns','doctorate','primaryedu','elementaryedu','highschool','literatebutnoschool','notliterate','middleschool','master','university','fertilityrate','electricity','numberofattempts','housingsalesnumbers')\n\nregion26 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\", sheet = \"Bolge26\")\nnames(region26) &lt;- c('region','region2id','workforce15plus','workforce1564','usableincome')\n\nmigration &lt;- read_excel(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\zeyne\\\\Desktop\\\\DataVizards_FinalDataFrame.xlsx\", sheet = \"Goc Bilgileri\")\nnames(migration) &lt;- c('IDD','male2','female2','turnbackfamily','unknowns2','betterlifecond','others','education','retirement','buyhome','familymig','finjob','maritalstatuschange','health','appointment','age04_2','age59_2','age1014_2','age1519_2','age2024_2','age2529_2','age3034_2','age3539_2','age4044_2','university2','highschool2','middleschool2', 'elementaryschool2')\n\n\n# tidy migration data set\nmigration$city &lt;- population$city\nmigration$regions &lt;- population$regions\n\ntidy_data_gender &lt;- migration |&gt;
